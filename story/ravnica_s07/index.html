<p>Darkness had already consumed alleyways of Ravnica when the party exited
Neirius lab. Large streets were fighting off the dark with magilight posts and
lamps held by Azorius patrols. Motion in the streets had reduced a quite a bit
when compared to the middle of the day, but Ravnica never truly sleeps. In this
district people were minding their own business at this hour. Usually open
corner stands were no longer there. No callers shouting latest news walked
among the now thin traffic. A dark figure leaning on a lamppost caught Nai&rsquo;s
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I, um, have to do something on my own. I will find you soon.&rdquo;, Nai
turned to a dark alley heading towards Ismeri library. Dark figure followed
suite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;, Shinigami asked, yet instead of an answer Nai simply
put her hood up and disappeared behind a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems she has her own agenda too.&rdquo;, Wataru said, &ldquo;Leave her to it for now.
We should focus on beer and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;, Katrille nodded and turned towards the inn Neirius described.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Tavern&rsquo;s windows were boarded shut, door had seen better days too. A torch lit
sign stated that this is &ldquo;Water and some Fire inn&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo;, Shinigami opened the battered door to a warm lit tavern.</p>
<p>A large room crowded with furniture and patrons opened before their eyes. A
hulking figure stood behind the bar. It&rsquo;s muscular back was naked and covered
in scars and fading tattoos. Shinigami approached the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is this place called like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Figure turned around slowly. She held a glass between her fingers and used her
thick towel covered finger to polish it. She stopped twisting the finger and
looked at the small human girl with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we serve water here. And strong spirits, which are fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sweet voice that escaped ogre&rsquo;s throat through sharpened tusks did not
match her appearance at all. She sounded more like an aged grandmother, not
like a building wrecking beast she looked like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have three of your <em>fire</em> drink, then&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ogre placed the freshly polished glass on the counter and retrieved two more
along with a bottle from under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be six zibs, little one&rdquo; she said pouring murky liquid into the
glasses.</p>
<p>Remaining party looked around the tavern in the meantime. They took an empty
table between a large group discussing some sort of sports event and a
scientist trio that were deep into their drinks and now had been quite loudly
arguing about their experiments. A lonely dark figure sat in the far corner of
the inn and played with a platinum coin.</p>
<p>Shinigami, brought the drinks to the table, gulped her in one go and navigated
through other patrons directly to the dark figure, who by all means looked like
someone that does not want to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Others watched as the dark figure shifted into the taverns light, revealing a
rough face with three long scars marking his left eye. Shinigami conversed for
a while with him and skimmed back between the chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a little talk, he said we can do a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What job?&rdquo; Wataru asked shifting forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said 300 platinum, split half-half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;3000 zibs??? You are joking right?&rdquo; Katrille asked in disbelief</p>
<p>&ldquo;What job?&rdquo; Wataru asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, wait.&rdquo; Shinigami strode back to the man in the corner.</p>
<p>They talked inaudibly, then the man flipped his coin and gestured Shinigami to
guess. She returned slightly disappointed back to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he will meet us in an hour in a backstreet behind the Stone Brewers.
He said he will go now to get his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This does not sound too convincing to me, Shinigami&rdquo; Wataru spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks dangerous to me, too&rdquo; Katrille seconded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, he is very friendly. He talks bit funny though.&rdquo; Shinigami changed her
voice to match the dark man&rsquo;s, &ldquo;All deep and rough, like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either way, we must return before Neirius comes&rdquo; Wataru said watching the man
leave the tavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you at least get his name?&rdquo; Katrille asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he said he is Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the worst case, I think we could get a coin for his head.&rdquo; Wataru said
staring at the closed tavern door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go after him.&rdquo;, Shinigami suddenly said and stood up, &ldquo;Meet you behind
the Brewers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Rakdos girl opened the door and looked at the figure in the distance, she
slipped out and trailed Joseph from the shadows as best as she could.</p>
<p>Wataru and Katrille took one more drink and waited for a while before standing
up and leaving towards the Stone Brewers.</p>
<p>They caught up to Shinigami standing before a one story building with a sign
shaped as a beer keg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it. I saw him talk with two other men, but all of them came here
through different way, so I could follow only Joseph.&rdquo; Shinigami reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, should we go in, or should we turn around and go back to our drinks?&rdquo;,
Wataru asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look around.&rdquo;, Shinigami with dexterity of Rakdos performer climbed on
the brewery&rsquo;s roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okey, there are three men in the back of this alley and four other are waiting
there&rdquo;, Rakdos pointed to two pairs of figures eyeing them from a distance. &ldquo;I
go in, you stay here and hold them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about me? I don&rsquo;t want to get into fight at all.&rdquo; Katrille asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb on the roof and shoot?&rdquo;, Shinigami proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope this will be worth it&rdquo;, Wataru said and took his hammer out while
Katrille ascended the drainpipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, so what will you tell me&rdquo;, Shinigami asked the three men in the
alley after she approached them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pretty sure you know what we are going to tell you.&rdquo;, Joseph said and
attacked the girl with his longsword.</p>
<p>Shinigami dodged the blow and together with all three men disappeared in a
bubble of complete darkness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wataru was surrounded by four thugs, three humans and a goblin.
Wataru touched his Boros charm and a wave of thunder forcefully slammed into
the thugs. Goblin was swept of his feet, while other thugs managed to stand
firm and landed a few painful blows back at the war phant'. Wataru swung his
hammer and another blast of thunder echoed around him, this time blasting all
the thugs away. Loxodon wasted no time and slammed his hammer at the nearest
thug making his limp body hit the ground with a soft thud. Goblin, still
scrambling on the floor turned and ran. Another thug landed a hurtful blow at
the back of Wataru&rsquo;s head, to which elephant responded with a angry shout and
swung his hammer in an arc landing on the side of the head of the said thug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo;, last one of the thugs shouted as his friend collapsed, he pushed the
elephant with all his might making just a little space between them, then
grabbed Steve by his belt, threw him over his shoulder and ran.</p>
<p>Wataru stood for a split second watching the human retreating with his friend
on his shoulder, then trumpeted in anger and ran after. His hammer landed on
the side of the retreating human forcing him to shout in pain. Tears started
flowing his rugged face. But he did not stop, he ran like his, and Steve&rsquo;s
lives would depend on it. Which, by the look on the Loxodon&rsquo;s face, surely did.
After few dozens of steps Wataru stopped and reconsidered his rage. He turned
around and saw Shinigami unconscious on the ground with blood all over her.
Katrille was exchanging icy blasts to arrows with the single remaining thug in
the end of the alley. While Wataru ran back the thug fell down with three
glowing darts slowly dissipating in the dark. Katrille slid down the drainpipe
and together with Wataru approached unconscious body of Rakdos girl. Most of
the blood she was laying in was not hers. She managed to slice open two thugs,
before passing out from a deep cut in her side. Wataru put his healing hand on
the lifeless body and prayed to the angel that she would not die. At least not
today. He did the same for the fallen thugs, but one of them had already
crossed the boundary of life and death.</p>
<p>Meanwhile goblin slipped from behind a pair of boxes and came back to his
friend that lied motionless at the entry to the alley. He started dragging his
body behind a corner when Katrille noticed him, shouted and ran after. When she
turned the corner she found only an empty potion bottle and two distant figures
running away with all their might.</p>
<p>Wataru looted bodies of fallen thugs while he was alone in the back. He took a
crossbow, a platinum coin and a ticket for a 50 zino stake on someone named
J&rsquo;okhana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time I carry you, reckless Rakdos girl&rdquo;, Wataru sighed and took the
motionless Shinigami.</p>
<p>He looked at Katrille and without words turned back to the &ldquo;Water and some
Fire&rdquo; inn.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth happened to you? I left you for a brief moment and now you are
all covered in blood!&rdquo;, Neirius exclaimed when he saw unconscious Shinigami on
Wataru&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We crossed some thugs in our way&rdquo;, Wataru said dryly and placed the girl into
a chair and adjusted her body so that she would not fall down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you managed to completely loose blue cloaked girl too?&rdquo;, Neirius looked
around the tavern searching for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she went off somewhere. And her name is Nai.&rdquo;, Wataru pondered for a
moment watching Katrille ordering something at the bar, &ldquo;Say, Neirius, you
don&rsquo;t really know Nai, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, I have met her a few times before, but I never considered her my friend,
no&hellip; And I did not send her anything if I remember correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph&rdquo;, Loxodon sat down behind the table keeping one arm on the passed out
Rakdos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what did you want from us?&rdquo;, Katrille asked placing three glasses of the
same murky alcohol they drank earlier on the table.</p>
<p>Neirius took the glass, downed the contents in one gulp and exhaled loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For starters, I need to thank you for taking me out of the grasp of Orzhov.
For that and for retrieving Artifimana Siphon.&rdquo;, Neirius took out his coin
pouch, and counted over a decent reward for all their trouble. &ldquo;But I am in
need of some protection and without saying I may not get it from Orzhov. Would
you work for me in the evenings? Does one zino a day sound reasonable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would very much like this&rdquo;, Wataru jumped to this opportunity as the debt
for his revival was looming over his thoughts for the last few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may find some time in my evenings to help out with your experiments too&hellip;&rdquo;,
Katrille looked at Neirius with a smirk on her usually emotionless face, &ldquo;But
you will share a bit of knowledge with me in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are as curious as always, Katrille.&rdquo;, their gazes met and they sat there
staring at each other for a moment longer than Wataru found comfortable,-
&ldquo;Fine. But no talking to others about what I am doing, deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have an agreement.&rdquo;, she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get the next round and we should at least wash her wounds. We can do
that at my laboratory. Actually it is too late for you to travel back home, so
you can all spend the night there.&rdquo;, Neirius suggested opening his arms widely,
&ldquo;And if something comes for me tonight, maybe I will have someone who can
protect me this time, heh.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="you-cant-understand-science">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand science&rdquo;</h1>
<p><date>10076 Mokosh 8, Azorsday</date></p>
<p>Wataru woke up from the sound of crackling electricity. There were muffled
shouts coming from the stairwell. He looked around the darkened room he slept
in. Neirius obviously cleaned it up a bit, compared to the last time he and Nai
visited it, but it was still a mess. Loxodon slowly shifted his large body
upright, trying not to wake other two girls that slept in the other side of the
room, and moved down into the laboratory. Bright light hit his eyes and he
covered them up in surprise. Four goblins were darting in the laboratory, which
looked nothing like they found it few days ago. Doors were back in place, most
of the equipment was back in order and loudly humming, arcs of electricity were
jumping between open contacts, fluorescent fluid was swirling in a weird
spherical shaped glass enclosure in the corner of thee room, Neirius stood in
the middle and was tweaking something in the cylinder shaped object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are awake, since I slept for three days straight I fixed things up
overnight, what do you think?&rdquo;, Neirius glanced over Wataru briefly and
returned his attention to whatever he was doing with Artifimana Siphon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found help during the night?&rdquo;, Wataru looked at the goblins in matching
jumpsuits. &ldquo;Are you sure they are appropriate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, don&rsquo;t worry. They come with a signed letter. They are part of The
Mizzium Goblins, I had not heard negative reviews about them. Yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the goblins, slightly more muscular that the remaining lot, had fixated
his eyes on the large loxodon and stopped moving. He had multiple empty earing
holes in both of his ears and only one small mizzium ring in his left one. Few
dark tattoos of wilderness and animals decorated his arms. He had a few old
scars here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you there!&rdquo;, Wataru stepped towards the goblin, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xoisk&hellip; Xoi. I am called Xoi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;, Wataru&rsquo;s voice rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo;, poor creature stammered and cowered as if trying to avoid a hit
from the large elephant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to tune the magnetic inertia on a manafuse you can&rsquo;t just use your
hands! You will desync the field manipulator turning it without precision!&rdquo;,
loxodon was now standing directly above him. Wataru grabbed a nearby tool wrap,
rolled it open, took out a straw shaped took with a slider and a gouge on it.
&ldquo;Here, let me show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goblin jumped out of the way and let Wataru to use his tool on the manafuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need it to be around 45-46, depending on expected flow.&rdquo;, elephant looked
at now trembling creature, &ldquo;Wait, have we met somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forest. You killed Breegork. I ran away. No hurt me. I work here now, no more
Gruul, can&rsquo;t go back, not after running from you.&rdquo;, he spilled in high pitched
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I am not here to hurt you. It is good that you chose science
instead of savagery. Now watch carefully&hellip;&rdquo;, Wataru twisted the tool in his
large hands. Suddenly a loud explosion roared over them, ground shook under
their feet, glass vials rattled, metallic pieces clanked and dust slowly
descended from the ceiling. &ldquo;There you go. 45.7 ohms. Should hold up to 5
zareks of mana flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that Sullemand made a discovery.&rdquo;, Neirius lifted his eyes from the
gauge he was intensely staring at for the last minute and scanned over the room
to see if anything was out of order, &ldquo;Could have chosen a better time for this.
Even without his involvement these readings are far beyond what I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls came tumbling down the narrow staircase obviously distressed by the
sound and shaking ground, only to find six figures calmly working in the
settling dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Shinigami tried to recover from shock of waking up from an
explosion in an unknown place with her wounds freshly bandaged. &ldquo;What is
happening here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was helping Xoi with&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scream from outside the door interrupted Wataru&rsquo;s explanation. Shinigami
stormed to the door and opened them into the street. Outside a pack of
lightning mephits were terrorizing morning commuters, zapping them with their
arms. In the distance Azorius whistle blew loudly. A dark cloud with electric
discharges zapping from it flew just few centimeters above ground. It stopped
in front of Shinigami and started to materialize into a large two armed
creature. It was all made from the same cloud, only now it was standing upright
and had two bright blueish eyes approximately where it&rsquo;s face should be.</p>
<p>Shinigami slammed the door shut and stepped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is happening outside, do not let that thing in!&rdquo;, Neirius commanded
watching the door, &ldquo;It can mess up everything I fixed over night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small trail of black cloud seeped through the gap between the door and the
ground. Trail got thicker every second, reforming the same creature inside the
laboratory.</p>
<p>Shinigami cursed and hurled a bolt of eldrich energy into the creature. Part of
the elemental dissipated on contact with the bolt, but quickly the missing part
was reformed. Katrille and Neirius followed suite, both hitting the creature
with their magic, but it continued slowly creeping towards Shinigami. Wataru
held his locket out and commanded a bolt of lightning into the angry looking
cloud. This time, instead of dissipating, the creature absorbed the lightning
and grew in all directions. It&rsquo;s newly formed appendage shot towards Shinigami
shocking her painfully on contact. Another juicy curse escaped Rakdos mouth as
she cut the cloud into two parts with her scythe and a bolt of electricity flew
over the shaft of her weapon contracting her muscles. While the creature was
reforming itself Katrille shot three magic darts, which made large holes in the
now weakened smoke elemental. Shinigami stepped back learning her mistake and
finished the creature off with another eldrich blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was this thing?&rdquo;, Katrille asked looking at Neirius for some explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most probably work of Sullemand, he is known to work with weirds and
summons.&rdquo;, Neirius replied with a shrug. &ldquo;Please keep those creatures out of my
laboratory. I really do not have the luxury of something messing with my
experiments right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the group stepped outside they were met with chaos. Humans, vedalkens and
goblins were running around or trying to fend of small lightning mephits,
flying smoke like creatures with painful zap to their touch. Azorius
peacekeepers were tangled up in the same chaos, casting binding spells and
trying to force those nasty creatures out of the air. A huge hole was torn open
in the second story of Sullemand&rsquo;s laboratory, though which mephits were flying
into the street.</p>
<p>Wataru turned to the reinforced door with Sullemand&rsquo;s brand burned on them.
After a fierce knock a goblin opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?! We are preoccupied at the moment if it is not important, go away!&rdquo;, a
creature with a burnt jumpsuit opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made quite the mess in the street, care to clean it up?&rdquo;, Wataru sensed an
opportunity to reduce his dept, &ldquo;Luckily we can be for hire if you need some
muscle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need nothing of you, get lost!&rdquo;, goblin was about to close the door as
Wataru grabbed a nearby mephit and threw it into the lab.</p>
<p>Sound of goblins being zapped joined the morning chaos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FINE. You get five zibs per critter.&rdquo;, goblin opened the door widely, &ldquo;You
start in the second floor and do not break anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten zibs&rdquo;, Shinigami joined the bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FIVE! This is my final off&hellip;&rdquo;, second loud explosion cut the goblin short.  A
cloud of smoke and lightning flew out from the hole in the second floor and
dropped behind the party in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a zino for the big ones!&rdquo;, Rakdos girl said with a melody in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I mean, the master is not here&hellip;&rdquo;, goblin seemed distressed as his
laboratory was plunging into chaos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo;, Wataru got the smell of a lucrative deal, &ldquo;I wonder what he
will do to you when he finds his experiments running wild for everyone to see
and no data collected because you were too busy getting your hides zapped
around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If goblins could turn pale, this one would have turned paper white. His eyes
darted from the chaos in the lab to the forming elemental in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zino for the big ones.&rdquo;, goblin finally muttered and opened the door,- &ldquo;Come
in quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First floor of Sullemand&rsquo;s laboratory was similar to what Neirius had in his
sub-basement. Machinery was buzzing and illuminating goblins, goblins were
running and flailing things at mephit, mephit was flying and zapping around.
Wataru took down the mephit with precise hammer swing and they walked through
the room to the stairs leading up. Upstairs they found three rooms, one of
which had it&rsquo;s doors open and morning sun was visible through the blasted wall.
Elephant and two girls entered the room and found a mizzium contraption holding
a weird ball sized mana bubble suspended between two metal arcs. To everybody&rsquo;s
surprise another lightning elemental came out from the mana bubble and the
bubble shrank to a tiny pebble.</p>
<p>Few seconds later the creature dissipated after receiving a final eldrich blast
and Shinigami went over the room to look outside. Azorius had almost disposed
of all the mephits and were now fighting the remaining large creature.</p>
<p>She turned around and pointed at once-again-ball-sized-mana-bubble. Her action
was followed by yet another curse. This time it came from Katrille&rsquo;s mouth.
Wataru ran out from the room, following mana cables to what he thought was the
power source for the contraption. To his surprise he found the mana capacitor
circuit broken, so by his knowledge the device should have been powered off,
not producing an endless stream of elementals. He heard Katrille shouting
something vulgar directed at Shinigami, when he ran back into to the room, mana
bubble was no more. Instead there was a pulsating crack in the wall behind the
device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?!&rdquo;, Wataru exclaimed with disbelief</p>
<p>&ldquo;She threw her scythe into the portal!&rdquo;, Katrille explained rather agitatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about to pop another of those creatures again!&rdquo;, Shinigami said in self
defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will happen now?&rdquo;, Wataru asked.</p>
<p>Trio stood for a moment and watched as a hand-shaped cloud clung to one side of
the pulsating crack. Then another emerged from inside and started spreading the
crack wider.</p>
<p>Shinigami shot eldrich blast at it. Crack lit up brightly and with a loud pop
became twice the size it was before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;STOP!&rdquo;, Wataru shouted in vain. A creature four times the size of the one they
were fighting before stepped into the room through the gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;, Katrille prepared her spells again to fight the creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to ground it!&rdquo;, Wataru shouted over the crackling of electric
discharges on the creature&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to tackle it?&rdquo;, Shinigami asked confused, &ldquo;It will shock us
to death if we hug it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you simpleton!&rdquo;, Wataru tore one of the larger cables off the floor and
jerked it loose from the machine it was connected to, &ldquo;We will use this to
drain the electricity from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could work! Rakdos, take the end and slam it into it!&rdquo;, Katrille ordered
while shooting magic darts at the creature with little effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it always Rakdos this, Shinigami that?&rdquo;, girl mumbled while taking the
cable, with a crazy scream she ran into the creature like a knight with a
wobbly lance.</p>
<p>As the cable connected to the charged body a web of discharges disappeared from
it in an instant, creature roared and slammed the girl throwing her off balance
to the ground. Wataru stepped the between fallen girl and the creature and
started pounding the smoky form with his hammer. Shinigami stood up, summoned
her scythe and circled the amorphous being to get a better position. Her final
swing cut the creature in half and with that the smoke dropped on the floor and
dissipated.</p>
<p>Wataru swiped sweat from his forehead and looked and the crack in the wall.  It
seemed dormant at the moment, but Krokt knows what other creatures can get
through it now.</p>
