<h1 id="treading-the-treacherous-undercity">Treading the treacherous undercity</h1>

<p>Group quickly rushed through the damp and dirty tunnel. Their steps were echoed
by the sound of water jet slamming in the cobblestones and leathery wings
swinging above the entrance to the tunnel. They delved deeper into what seemed
to be abandoned passageways. Broken pieces of ancient architecture, remnants of
cobblestone roads, towered by newly built structures. Here and there fragments
of blue sky shined through.</p>

<p>Nai was leading the group through this maze of underworld roads and alleys.
Suddenly she stopped blinded by the sun gleaning through a gap in the roof of
an ancient shrine. She felt a touch on her shoulder. &ldquo;There, behind the statue,
there is a huge groove a snake made in the muck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her gaze followed Rozhe&rsquo;s finger to see a dark stone angels bust, with broken
off wings and wines crawling up the base of it. After squinting in the light
she saw the trail pressed in the dirt, with leaves shuffled to the sides.  Nai
slowly moved in to the church and crept by the eastern wall. Her sight adjusted
as she left the dazing sunlight. A huge serpent like creature was coiled up
behind the statue, apparently waiting to ambush unsuspecting passerby.</p>

<p>Just as she turned to silently return, a piece of stone tile snapped of loudly
echoing through the shrine. Serpent creature hissed and slithered around the
base of the statue uncoiling to it&rsquo;s full length. The thick serpentine body was
at least as long as Nai was high. She carefully backed away from the incoming
monstrosity, preparing for defence. The creature sprung forward with four
tentacles unwrapping from a bone beak. Tentacles reached forward trying to
latch on Nai&rsquo;s extended arm, but due to her quick reaction only hit the blade
of her shortsword. Creature backed away and hissed loudly.</p>

<p>Another hiss echoed back from the darkness. &ldquo;I think there is more.&rdquo; Nai
whispered to others behind her. Rozhe stepped forward &ldquo;Wait, let me talk to them, maybe these
creatures will let us pass.&rdquo; and started humming a tune.
Few notes later she sang &ldquo;Slithery creatures of the night, let us stay alive
tonight, pass us through to the other side&hellip;&ldquo;. She expected something of an
answer, but instead she heard loud hisses coming from the darkest corners in
this chapel. &ldquo;Feeed&hellip; Feeeeeed! FEEED!&rdquo;, the meaning behind the hisses
was clear, but the creatures did not seem to understand anything the elven girl
sang to them. She shook her head, &ldquo;I doubt they will listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrille&rsquo;s owl
spread her wings and flew from her shoulder, did a little circle near the
ceiling on the right side of the room. It scanned the floor for other serpent
like creatures but none were visible. The one that was slithering back from Nai
had a grey patchy skin and no distinct pattern so it was difficult to see where
the rocky ground ended and the serpent began. Owl returned on it&rsquo;s masters
shoulder and started gnawing between her wing feathers. Katrille turned to Nai:
&ldquo;I could see nothing. What should we do? We walked here before, maybe let&rsquo;s
just go?&ldquo;. &ldquo;But before there were no creatures here!&rdquo; Nai shook her head
keeping her blade pointed at the serpent, &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think they are friendly
or very talkative either.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me show you how to talk to these creatures!&rdquo;
Shinigami nearly shouted over the loudening hiss coming from all sides. She
stepped into the room, turned to one side, stepped out from the blinding light
that was flowing through the collapsed roof and summoned her scythe. &ldquo;Hissss&rdquo;
She replied to the serpent and swung her scythe between it&rsquo;s tentacles. Serpent
swerved to one side, almost dodging the blow, but the blade bit the flesh
making a nasty cut on the side. It hissed loudly and started slithering
backwards to the eastern wall. Rakdos performer made a grimace and hissed again
at the creature, aggressively. This, or the pain in it&rsquo;s side, forced the
creature reconsider it&rsquo;s hunger and it turned and tried to slither away.
Shinigami seeing this swung her scythe and made another deep cut in the
creature. Serpent hissed and disappeared in a crumbled hole in the eastern
wall, next to a door leading to a dark tunnel. While this was taking place,
remainder of the party tried to cross the room through the right side, led by
Elfur and Rozhe they carefully treaded between old and crumbled marble columns.
Another creature appeared from under a pile of stones in far left corner of the
room and slid to Shinigami, it opened it&rsquo;s tentacled mouth and latched on the
girls torso. Sharp edges on the tentacles dug into the paper white flesh, with
blood appearing on her not-yet-ruined cloak which she took from a bystander
earlier. Her lips pressed into a hellish smile, deep growling came out of her
mouth followed by red flames erupting throughout the skin of the creature. In
great pain creature lunged forward aiming at the girls heart. Only in the last
moment Rakdos managed to re-summon her scythe between her and the sharp beak.
Creature kept trying to snap at her chest, but Shinigami held the beak as far
away from herself as the tentacles allowed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the other side Nai, Elfur and Rozhe were engaged by another of
these large creatures, which came from behind a broken altar. Their weapons
slashed and cut and pierced the creatures skin, but the flesh inside did not
give to plain metal and was as thick as stone. Wataru stayed behind the group
and tied up the poor fella they had been carrying from the surface. His
paralysis was starting to fade and loxodon was not taking any chances. After he
was done, he placed the human on the ground and observed the situation.</p>

<p>Shinigami was being surrounded by those creatures, as one more dropped from the
ceiling and just by pure performers reaction she managed to jump out from the
grasp of it&rsquo;s tentacles. From behind a third serpent slithered out from the
darkness and grappled Shinigami&rsquo;s leg in a cold and hard clutch. Katrille fired
few cold blasts toward the creatures surrounding Rakdos girl, missing them
entirely, most probably because of a dusty strip of bright light between her
and her targets. Nai had better luck and shot one of the creatures dead. With
tentacles no longer latching to her torso Shinigami could move freely and
attacked the serpent that painfully attached itself to her leg. Her sweep sunk
into the side leaving a gushing wound.</p>

<p>Elfur and Rozhe were dealing with their serpent slowly but surely. The serpent
latched to Elfur&rsquo;s shield and the paladin dropped it entirely. Took his axe in
both hands and cleaved relentlessly at the stone hard creatures flesh. Rozhe
cited a piece of dark poetry, her arrow swelled with dark energy and pierced
the creatures belly, making it almost shriek in agony. Feeling that this hunt
is going to end poorly for it, creature slithered back avoiding blows from both
elves and crossed the bright strip of crumbled marble in the middle of the
shrine.</p>

<p>Wataru decided to act, before any of his compatriots fell. He charged towards
Shinigami and slammed his hammer into one of the serpents, sending it flying
with a hammer shaped cavity in the side of it&rsquo;s skull. &ldquo;I can handle this
myself, stay out of my performance!&rdquo; Shinigami grunted through pain. &ldquo;Shut it.&rdquo;
Loxodon adjusted his grip and prepared to strike another monstrosity.</p>

<p>Only two creatures remained moving in the room, and had already realised that
this prey is not theirs to take. Both of them slithered into the darkness
behind a doorway. At the very last moment Elfur charged past the hurt Shinigami
and Wataru and embedded shining axe into the tail of one of them, making the
part outside of the cavity fall limp. Rakdos seeing this as an insult to her
act jumped over the corpse, cartwheeled into the darkness and carved the last
snake in half with a swift pull of her scythe. &ldquo;Blood was spilled in the name
of entertainment! Rejoice and applaud!&rdquo; she spun on her heels and threw her
scythe spinning towards unsuspecting Nai. Moments before Nai could react she
snapped the scythe out of existence leaving a puff of smoke which hit Nai in
the chest and dissipated. Wataru silently scratched behind his ear
uncomfortably. Nai said nothing just shook her head. &ldquo;Come on, show at least
some support for the fine arts.&rdquo; Shinigami scoffed and disappeared into the
depth of the corridor though which the serpents tried to escape. Others heard
rummaging and sounds of excitement in the darkness. And a muffled moan behind
them. Wataru turned around and picked up still dazed human from the ground and
followed others into the darkness.</p>

<p>There was a small room at the end of the corridor. Filled with piles of bone,
pieces of old ragged cloth, rusty weapons and old leaves. Shinigami was darting
from one serpent nest to another, rummaging through muck and leaves,
occasionally gasping as if she found something of great value. Others followed
suite trying to beat one another to whatever spoils were in this room. Wataru
placed the human on the floor and walked around the room slowly shuffling the
dirt with his thick feet. After a full circle he sat at the entrance blocking
the door. His demeanor was unreadable and he kept scratching his trunk.</p>

<p>After thorough search of the room was finished, Nai turned her attention to the
bonded whimpering human with a broken nose. Most probably he slammed his face
on the cobblestones just as he was paralyzed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to talk to you&rdquo; Nai approached the dark haired man, lying on his side.
&ldquo;Who are you people, please let me go&hellip;&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;I have done nothing to
deserve this.&rdquo; Shinigami peeked behind Nai&rsquo;s shoulders and blew a raspberry at
the guy.  &ldquo;We just need to ask you a couple of questions and that&rsquo;s it&rdquo; Nai
tried to calm the guy down. &ldquo;Or we will cut you open like this guy!&rdquo; Shinigami
jumped out with a human skull in her hand, she snapped it&rsquo;s jaw a few times and
acted as if the skull was talking &ldquo;Ye better listen, these folk are mean&rdquo;, to
which Shinigami responded with a gasp &ldquo;Ah! You traitor!&rdquo; and hid the skull in
her bag. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to it, we would never hurt a fly&rdquo; she finished with an
exaggerated shy posture.  &ldquo;Listen, it&rsquo;s okay, I will not let them near you&rdquo;
Rozhe came to a rescue.  &ldquo;Can you please untie me?&rdquo; the man asked in a shaking
voice. Nai nodded at Wataru who was blocking the only exit from the chamber
then nodded to Rozhe.  Rope fell loose on the floor, the man sat up straight
and rubbed his bleeding nose. &ldquo;Who are you and why am I here?&rdquo; &ldquo;We took you to
answer a couple of questions about The Gift of Life.&rdquo; Rozhe began in a soft
voice &ldquo;We wanted to ask them after you finished your speech in the street, but
the wyvern and the Boros mixed things up a bit. Sooo, what is your name,
mysterious number three?&rdquo; &ldquo;Zikmund&rdquo; he answered dryly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we are not
going to hurt you.&rdquo; Rozhe kept trying to calm him down. &ldquo;Could I get something
to drink?&rdquo; he looked around in the faint light that was coming through the
doorway. &ldquo;Sure&rdquo; Rozhe extended her canteen. He took a few gulps. &ldquo;What do you
want to know?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why have you protested in the street?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because Simic are
destroying the nature&rsquo;s natural order, and not only that, they are destroying
people&rsquo;s lives!&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; He uncovered his shoulders and chest. He
was covered in blue scales with golden stripes extending from gold scaled
belly. &ldquo;They made me like this and then threw away, because I was a failure.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who threw you out?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Simic. Scientist Serilius. He was the one who did
this to me. We were part of the Doorway Project. We were all naive and young
and in need of coin. I just wanted to be like my sister. She was smart.  But I?
All I could do was volunteer. They used us as lab rats and when the experiments
failed they just threw us all away. We were castaways. We were outsiders.
Nobody wanted to do anything with us.&rdquo; his breath was uneven, he fell silent
and rubbed his eyes. &ldquo;Then we met Father Vuduin. He gave us hope. A community.
A sense of home. We all became his children. And we pledged to fight for
others. And for nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does destroying Simic laboratories counts as your way
of fighting?&rdquo; Nai intercepted. &ldquo;What? No! Well, at least not for majority of
us.&rdquo; he lowered his eyes. &ldquo;We had a new member recently. I think his name was
Eduard. When we heard what he did we had a meeting. He was scolded by Father
Vuduin for acting recklessly and not within Selesnya&rsquo;s teachings. He did not
return after that night.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who else is in this group of yours?&rdquo; Nai pressed on.
&ldquo;What? There are hundreds of followers, I don&rsquo;t know everyone&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;No, are
there others with numbers on their hands?&rdquo; she clarified. &ldquo;Um, yes, I am not
the only one. I don&rsquo;t know all of them either. I know Boris and Laura. Boris is
a dwarf and has a claw instead of his left arm, Laura is really pretty, but she
has tentacles instead of her mouth.&rdquo; Rozhe looked at his arm and saw a
calligraphic number three tattooed on his handbreadth. &ldquo;What are their
numbers?&rdquo; she asked slowly taking his arm into hers. &ldquo;Um, Boris is number seven
and Laura is eleven, why do you ask?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just curious.&rdquo; Nai stood up &ldquo;Ok, I think
we heard everything, anyone has any more questions? Katrille, maybe you have
anything to say? You are Simic after all.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, I&hellip; No.&rdquo; her voice
staggered a bit. &ldquo;We should go, much to do today.&rdquo; Wataru stood up shifting his
weight with his hammer.</p>

<hr />

<p>As the party left the crumbled church and walked down slightly descending path
darkness grew thicker and foul. They reached a chasm, extending far deeper than
any of them could see. Dark scar in the earth was pressing against narrow
crumbling pathway and threatened to devour anyone reckless enough to step on
slippery stones at the edge. Naturally Shinigami made a cartwheel on the very
edge. Unfortunately her foot slipped, she did spun her hands with panic in her
face, trying to keep her balance. At the very last moment she summoned her
scythe to grapple nearby edge and pulled herself back up. She stood firmly on
the path and bowed to the remainder of the party. Nobody clapped. &ldquo;Tough
crowd.&ldquo;, she scoffed. Wataru pressed his large body to the wall and passed the
narrow walkway trying to keep his large body as far from the edge as possible.
Others crossed the most dangerous parts with care too. After the chasm branched
away from the path and hid behind firm stone walls party relaxed their careful
pace. Crumbled stone walls were changed to spacious caverns, with Golgari rot
farms sprawling here and there. The usual zombie laborers were planting
something large in one of the farms, currently heavily infested with waspcrabs,
which flew in swarms and consumed the bloodcaps and weyheads, which were
growing in batches on piles of refuse.</p>

<p>After the sweet stench of decay, party was greeted by noisy street in afternoon
sun. Walls on ether side of the street were covered in banners and posters.</p>

<p>The largest black banners announced a festival that is happening all throughout
Mokosh, which will be honored by weekly fighting competitions. The very next
fight will happen tonight, in The Oathkeeper Emporium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tickets are as low as 5 zibs&rdquo;, Nai announced looking at the remainder of the
party. Shinigami furrowed her brows while Wataru touched his pouch
absentmindedly. &ldquo;I would rather spill some blood in the heart of Orzhov by the
name of Rakdos!&ldquo;, pale girl cackled, &ldquo;Just imagine the spectacle, I would light
the fire where dark sun barely shines!&ldquo;. A moment of silence befell the group,
everybody was considering watching the pale girl in the ring, fighting to the
death. Apart from Rozhe and Elfur, everyone silently smiled. Including
Shinigami.</p>
